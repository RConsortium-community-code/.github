# Welcome to the R Consortium Community Code Repositories

This is a collection of code by our community members. 

If you would like to submit a new repository please send an email to [Admin@r-consortium.org](mailto:Admin@r-consortium.org) with your idea and we will make a new Repository for you to publish your code. 

This is just one resource for the community. Many more are available such as [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code?language=R).
