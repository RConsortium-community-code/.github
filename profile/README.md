# Welcome to the R Consortium Community Code Repositories

This is a collection of code by our community members. 

If you would like to submit a new repository please send an email to [Admin@r-consortium.org](mailto:Admin@r-consortium.org) with your idea and we will make a new Repository for you to publish your code. 

This is just one resource for the community. Many more are available such as [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code?language=R).

When you submit your repository, you should have at minimum: 
- License File (should be open source)
- Instructions for what the repository does
- Runnable code
- Data or a link to the public data
  - Minimal data file showing how to run code (ideally < 5MB)
  - Data should not reference actual people or any personally identifying information
